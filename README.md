A web-site that allows the user to introduce their favorite movies with their actors and keep track of them. The site was build using Angular for front-end , Spring and JDBC for back-end and an Oracle database for storage. The searching of actors could be done either by ID or by the actor’s name and the results where ordered alphabetically by the name. The films could be searched using the ID, the film’s name or by selecting the genre. The results where also ordered by the film’s name. Unit testing was done for service layer and integration testing for repository layer.
